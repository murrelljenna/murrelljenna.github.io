title: "Fixing the power supply of an old Atari 2600"
---

I'm on a bit of a retro kick and am riding the wave still from my last post about working with an Amiga 1000. I've ended up with an
Atari 2600 in my possession.

Way back in highschool I collected these out of fascination. Often, they were in terrible shape. This one now is no exception. While this unit
turns on fine (usually), it has a flaw - the power cuts in and out. Wiggling where the AC adapter connects to the back of the unit can bring it
back alive, but this is no way to play Donkey Kong.

The AC adapter seems fine. The problem is in the unit itself. Luckily, I've actually dealt with this problem before, way back in highschool
when I had a stronger interest in these systems. I believe this is the result of a weakened solder connection between the power adapter at
the back of the Atari (where the male plug of the power chord plugs into) and the main board of the atari. Let's test this theory.

I start by opening it up by unscrewing four screws on the bottom and... it's open. Well that was fast.

Here's the power supply.

It seems like the solder has cracking around the connection. The actual power supply component is quite wobbly too. I'm really bad at soldering, 
but that doesn't stop me from potentially destroying things by soldering nonetheless. I tin up my solder pen and heat up the cracked solder
to see if it will repair the cracking, then drop some extra solder on the connection for good measure.

And suddenly the actual power supply doesn't wobble anymore, it's quite fixed in place. Did this actually fix our issue though? Let's find out.
I power on the board and plug it into the TV to see if I can get and maintain picture, even while the atari is moved around.

Success!
