title: "Dug Out The Amiga 1000"
---

For over 5 years, my boyfriend and I have had this sitting in a box, hidden away in storage. I finally broke it out today.

Here it is in all its 1982 glory.

While this machine was intimidating at first, it has become surprisingly simple to get running. All the cables were still present, and the whole thing works. 
Along with it came a dizzying amount of old floppies.

Among them are the included Amiga Kickstart, Amiga Workbench and Textcraft.

I did not know this as someone born in 1994, but floppy disks are REALLY unreliable - all instruction manuals strongly suggest making copies of any purchased
software. I thought you weren't supposed to copy that floppy.

Included is an absolutely awesome boxed copy of some sort of C compiler. The compiler is across 6 different floppies. If you're programming without a hard drive,
you need to switch between 3 different floppies just to load the compiler into memory each time you want to compile your C code.

I'd love to try doing some work on this. So far, I've written a few simple C programs, but I'd love to dive into the novelty of doing coding and other work on this,
until I get tired of it in a few weeks. To do that, I've purchased some brand new unformatted 3.5" floppy disks off of Amazon that miraculously work with this machine.

Here we go!
