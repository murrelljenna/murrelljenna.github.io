### Boggs CRM for Community Organizing
##### <em>April 2020 - April 2021</em>
Django/React CRM for community organizing named after activist and philosopher Grace Lee Boggs.

Designed for small community organizations with inexperienced organizers. I started building this with the objective of creating a smaller, more streamlined database software than larger solutions like CiviCRM, but with more features and structure than excel or google sheets.

In particular Boggs was meant to support tenant organizing, so the data model was organized around buildings and small scale local organizing.

My perceived strongpoint of this app was its streamlined excel/google-sheets like interface that can still express granular details like status history.

Perhaps I will return, but I've largely dropped this project for now.

### Dynamic Mailto Links
##### <em>October 2020 - January 2021</em>
Wordpress widget to write templated links that respond to information available to your blog.

This was honestly kind of a bad idea. I was driven to make this because I wanted to have a wordpress blog randomize certain aspects of a mailto link on each page load. That is very easy to accomplish with this tool, but this widget also allows wordpress creators to template a link based on date/time and user location, among other things. 

I have yet to encounter anyone that actually wants to do this though. This is further evidenced by the fact that noone uses this.

### Online Tic-Tac-Toe and Battleship in C
##### <em>October 2018 - February 2019</em>
Text games I made learning C in college.

The game is played by 2 players either hot-seat style or live with one-another. No server/client - players communicate their moves to eachother by reading and writing to a file.
